# minishell-2
This project follows the first part of the project adding new specificities

{EPITECH} | First year | Unix System programming project

## Project Description

The goal of the project is to enrich your `minishell1` project by adding semicolons (`;`), pipes (`|`), and the four redirections (`>`, `<`, `>>`, `<<`) management. 

Priority management is a key part of this project. 

Before starting, ensure you have a functional `minishell1` as you will need to execute binaries. 

Error output, standard input, and standard output redirections will be considered as bonuses, such as `2>&1`.

## Example

``` bash
\<\/B-PSU-200> ./mysh
$> ls -l; ls -l | wc -l
total 4
drwxr-xr-x 2 johan johan 4096 Mar 17 16:28 tata
-rw-rr 1 johan johan 0 Mar 17 16:28 toto

```

See the subject for further details !
Usage :  make
        ./mysh
